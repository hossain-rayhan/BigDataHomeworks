    "In the next cell, you will implement the key components of the $k$-means clustering algorithm.  The first piece of the algorithm is calculating the mean coordinates of each cluster. In plain terms, to calculate the mean (i.e., average) $x$-coordinate of Cluster $j$, you must first find all of the points in the cluster. Then you must sum their $x$-coordinate values.  Finally, you divide that sum by the number of points in the cluster.  This produces the mean $x$-coordinate.  You must repeat this process for the $y$-coordinate (or for greater efficiency, you can perform it in parallel with the $x$-coordinate calculation). The equation below demonstrates how to calculate the mean coordinates of a given cluster:\n",

In this function, **your task is to read in the points from the provided file, cluster the points into $K$ clusters, and then return the clustering results (cluster centroids and clustered points)**.   Your code should accept two arguments: 1) the filename of the file containing the data that should be clustered and 2) the number of clusters to create. The input files we provide (`contig.txt` and `mickey.txt`) have one data point per line; the coordinates of the data points are two space delimited floating point numbers (i.e., $x$ and $y$). Your code should output the final centroids of each cluster as well as each point and its assigned cluster. Remember to use the functions that we have given you and that you have implemented in the previous cells (i.e., `readPointsFromFile`, `assignPointsToClosestCluster`, `calculateClusterMeans`, `assignPointsToClosestCluster`, and `calculateChangeInCentroids`.\n",
